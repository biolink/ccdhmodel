## Documentation:

* Model documentation published to https://cancerdhc.github.io/ccdhmodel/.

* Talk on the [CCDH Data Harmonization Workstream meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13PMvYlstQ9BNr_Br1HzZ9n7etkz5nCKxp_RbF0cL4n0).

## Automated generation of YAML

The model YAML files are programmatically generated from [the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWS7cao-fgz2MKWtyr8h2dEL9unX__0bJrWKv6mQmM4/).

The code that generates the YAMLs are in the [`./generators/google-sheets`](./generators/google-sheets) directory.
